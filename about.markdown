CULP helps liquidity providers for concentrated liquidity pools such as those on [Uniswap V3](https://uniswap.org/) and [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/swap) to calculate 
the liquidity needed for their liquidity positions.

The CULP software uses equations provided by [LIQUIDITY MATH IN UNISWAP V3](http://atiselsts.github.io/pdfs/uniswap-v3-liquidity-math.pdf) 
by Atis Elsts, September 30, 2021 to calculate its results.
